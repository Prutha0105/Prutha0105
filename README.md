# Prutha Desai - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Prutha. I am aspiring Data Analyst. I have 5+ years of experience in Data Analyst field. I have completed Masters of Technology in Computer Science in August,2019. I have developed my interest to show some meaningful insights from raw datasets. 

During my masters degree, I have published one paper on **Diseases inference on Medical datasets using Classification Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms** in Springer, 2019. In this analysis of machine learning and deep learning classification algorithms, i have taken breast cancer dataset. I have performed SMOTE functions as Data cleaning techniques. As a part of my studies i have analyse lions behavior by analysing lions in video and images. In that i have used openCV, Python, MATLAB. 

I am currently looking for jobs in Data Analyst role in Vienna, Austria. I am passionate about data and its imapct on future of our society. Over the past years, I have gained experience in Data engineering, Data modeling, Data architecture, Data schema, Data visualizations and other technologies and tools related to it.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
